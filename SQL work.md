# My SQL Homeworks

Here are my homeworks working with SQL. I want to emphasize that in each homework, I returned to mistakes and fixed them. That's who I really am. I strive to do everything to the best of my ability, even if there are small mistakes that don't significantly influence the overall picture of my score.
